### What is it?

Imining is a technology based Blockchain company that is invested into shaping Canada's blockchain and Cryptocurrency ecosystem. The company was founded in 2007 and has been led by Khurram Shroff, a well experienced entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor. Imining delivers crypto staking and crypto investing for people who don’t understand the intricate systems of crypto currency. They provide the necessary means for people new to crypto to start staking and investing into coins like ethereum and cardano. This is important due to the extremely high prices of coins like ethereum, that cost thousands of dollars for one coin. The network also requires that you hold more than one ETH in order to participate in Ethereum's PoS(proof of stake). To top it off, the process of staking coins is pretty complex and not many people want to go through the hassle of learning these intricate systems. Therefore, companies like Imining help to remove these expensive and complex barriers that everyday individuals may struggle with. Overall maintaining simplicity and network growth.

What gives Imining the ability to help individuals stake is through a service called CanEth. CanEth staking forms staking pools where everyday individuals don’t have to struggle to obtain several ethereum tokens in order to stake. By creating these pools, individuals need at least 1 Ethereum token in order to participate. Allowing for more participation in the network, and giving everyone a chance to gain some ethereum rewards. 

Imining also delivers a way to participate in trading crypto currency. Whether it’s trading or learning about crypto. Imining creates a very friendly environment for those looking to inform themselves about crypto. The crypto space can be very vast and information dense, Imining helps its users properly navigate the environment by providing tutorials on how crypto currency works and what coins to look into. Imining is an excellent place for both beginners and experts to explore crypto. 

### Why This Matters

Everyone who is in crypto understands how small the space is and having a company like Imining can help more individuals enter the market. Helping to improve the entry level for crypto can help increase use cases in the space. More participants can create more validators through mining and staking, while at the same discovering more developers and traders to influence crypto’s growth. Also by producing a staking company helps to improve crypto's environmental footprint as well. Many may know already that proof of work is one of the original networks for crypto blockchains on how transactions were approved. This created harsh environmental issues and did not create a healthy name for crypto currency. However, a proof of staking network helps to remove these environmental issues. By participating in these networks and making it easier to operate on them, participants don’t have to worry about the guilt of participating in such a network. Imining provides an easier means of trading crypto but also space to not only learn about crypto but to stake coins that may have been out of reach for some people. Creating a necessary environment to allow crypto to flourish.


### Why is this interesting?

Imining is helping to improving crypto's existance in the world for both investing, staking, and the environment. Imining is an approved investment and staking firm in ontario. For many Ontarians it's very difficult to find multiple crypto exchanges that will allow operation since the OSC(Ontario Securities Commission) doesn’t allow most exchanges to function in the province. So be assured that Imining has acquired the permissions of OSC to operate a publicly traded crypto exchange in Ontario. The company is also publicly traded so people may wish to invest in the company if they see fit(Not financial advice). The company also looks to venture intoareas of real estate to see if crypto can be used in order to purchase property. Having a company venture in new areas of how crypto can be used can help expand its reach as well. Imining is an expanding crypto company with a strong foundation. Led by Khurram Shroff, a bitcoin whale, this company will help to improve the future of crypto and help to search and discover more use cases.
